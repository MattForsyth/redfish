# Redfish 2013 summary


This subdirectory contains the results of the 2013 Redfish cruises. The summary is presented in HTML (more current) and PDF formats. For more info on the Redfish project please go [here](https://www.dal.ca/diff/cerc/news/2015/07/03/cruise_report__red_fish_survey.html) and [here](https://www.dal.ca/diff/cerc/news/2015/08/03/cruise_report__redfish___walther_herwig_iii.html). 

## Usage

To view the data summaries you simply need to access either the HTMl summary or the PDF summary. These are produced in R Markdown, but you will not be able to successfully run the Markdown code without the Redfish dataset.  

If you want the data, contact me at `matthewauvinen@gmail.com`. 

## file_guide

Also in this folder is the file_guide subdirectory. This contains LaTeX and PDF files that can help you find the original source for the raw data. The file guide will walk you through each of the folders that belong to the redfish project.
