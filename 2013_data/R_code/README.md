# R_code

This subdirectory contains R code that you can use to analyze the Redfish 2013 data. Each piece of code is numbered according to the order in which it is called in the master script. 

Use `master_script` to run all the code together. You will not be able to run any of the segments without running `00.R`, since that script contains the preamble necessary for all of the functions that follow.
